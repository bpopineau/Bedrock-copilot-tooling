## Why this project exists

Minecraft Bedrock add-on development is not just about generating a single valid JSON file.

A usable add-on usually requires:

- correct pack structure
- valid manifests
- consistent namespaces and identifiers
- correct cross-file references
- version-aware generation
- scripting conventions
- validation and repair loops
- packaging into a final deliverable

Prompting alone is good for prototypes, but not reliable enough for a repeatable engineering workflow.

This project exists to build a **compiler-like Bedrock add-on pipeline** instead of a one-shot prompt workflow.

---

## Project goals

### Primary goals

- Convert feature requests into **structured implementation specs**
- Generate **coherent Bedrock pack files**
- Keep identifiers, references, and layout consistent
- Make version targeting explicit
- Validate before declaring work complete
- Repair failures with minimal targeted changes
- Package only after passing required gates

### Non-goals

This project is **not**:

- a generic Bedrock doc chatbot
- a giant prompt stuffed with official documentation
- a single âmagic promptâ generator
- a many-model orchestration platform on day one
- a fine-tuning-first experiment

---

## Core idea

The core design principle is:

> **Frontier intelligence + local deterministic tooling**

This project uses a strong coding model for reasoning, then surrounds it with Bedrock-specific control, validation, repair, and packaging infrastructure.

Not:

> âHope the model remembers Bedrock correctly.â

And not:

> âFine-tune our way out of missing tooling.â

---

## Architecture

The system is organized into five layers.

### 1. Intelligence layer

Use Copilot / GPT-class reasoning for:

- intent interpretation
- multi-file planning
- add-on design decisions
- JSON / TypeScript generation
- nontrivial repair reasoning

### 2. Control layer

Use repo-native AI controls for consistency:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- path-specific instruction files
- reusable prompt files
- a custom Bedrock agent profile

### 3. Deterministic Bedrock layer

Use MCP tools for:

- version policy lookup
- manifest rule lookup
- file recipe lookup
- script rule lookup
- pack validation
- validation report parsing
- repair scaffolding
- packaging

### 4. Knowledge layer

Distill Bedrock docs into project-native assets:

- version policy
- version matrix
- file recipes
- migration notes
- gold examples
- curated vanilla examples

### 5. Quality gate layer

Every meaningful task flows through:

1. spec
2. plan
3. generate
4. validate
5. repair
6. revalidate
7. package

Nothing is âdoneâ until validation passes.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Spec

Translate a request into a strict internal spec.

The spec captures:

- requested feature
- target pack type
- target version policy
- required artifact families
- namespaces and identifiers
- assumptions
- acceptance criteria

### 2. Pack plan

Turn the spec into a Bedrock pack plan.

This includes:

- behavior pack vs behavior + resource pack
- manifest/module design
- folder layout
- script requirements
- dependencies
- asset requirements

### 3. Artifact generation

Generate only the artifacts required for the plan, such as:

- `manifest.json`
- items
- blocks
- entities
- loot tables
- animations
- controllers
- textures and metadata
- script entrypoints
- TypeScript logic

### 4. Validation

Run deterministic checks against the generated project.

### 5. Repair

If validation fails, repair using the **smallest safe change set**.

### 6. Packaging

Only package validated outputs.

## Quick start

### 1. Create the repo foundation

Create these first:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `docs/bedrock/version-policy.md`
- `docs/bedrock/version-matrix.json`
- `.github/agents/bedrock-addon-engineer.agent.md`

### 2. Add Bedrock knowledge assets

Populate:

- `docs/bedrock/file-recipes/`
- `docs/bedrock/migration-notes/`
- `examples/gold/`
- `examples/vanilla/`

### 3. Add AI control surfaces

Create:

- path-specific instruction files
- reusable prompt files
- the Bedrock agent profile

### 4. Build the first MCP tools

Start with:

- version policy lookup
- file recipe lookup
- validation
- validation report parsing

### 5. Wire the workflow

Implement the pipeline:

`spec -> plan -> generate -> validate -> repair -> revalidate -> package`

---

## Documentation strategy

Do **not** treat Bedrock documentation as a giant blob to paste into prompts.

Instead, convert it into a small set of curated engineering assets.

### Required outputs

#### `docs/bedrock/version-policy.md`

Defines the repoâs official targeting policy.

This should answer questions like:

- What Bedrock version policy do we follow?
- When are preview-only features allowed?
- How are migrations handled?
- What is the default script target policy?

#### `docs/bedrock/version-matrix.json`

Maps artifact families to the correct version expectations.

Examples:

- manifests
- items
- blocks
- entities
- animations
- controllers
- scripts
- pack metadata

#### `docs/bedrock/file-recipes/`

Short operational guides for each artifact family.

Each file recipe should include:

- purpose
- required location
- required fields
- optional fields
- common mistakes
- minimal valid example
- cross-file dependencies

#### `docs/bedrock/migration-notes/`

Tracks generation-relevant behavior changes.

#### `examples/gold/`

Small trusted canonical examples that reflect preferred patterns.

#### `examples/vanilla/`

Curated official-style examples used for grounding.

## Agent model

This project uses **role-based orchestration**, but not many separately trained models at the start.

### Spec Agent

Responsible for:

- interpreting requests
- creating internal implementation specs
- defining assumptions and acceptance criteria

### Pack Planner Agent

Responsible for:

- deciding pack topology
- planning manifests, dependencies, and file layout
- selecting required artifact families

### Artifact Generator Agent

Responsible for:

- generating JSON and TypeScript artifacts
- following version policy
- preserving naming and identifier consistency

### Validator Agent

Responsible for:

- running deterministic checks
- surfacing precise failures
- blocking completion until gates pass

### Repair Agent

Responsible for:

- applying minimal targeted fixes
- using validator output as the primary guide
- avoiding unrelated rewrites

### Packager Agent

Responsible for:

- assembling final outputs
- packaging only after validation succeeds

> These are workflow roles first.  
> They do not need to be separate models on day one.

---

## MCP toolset

The initial Bedrock MCP toolset should include the following.

### `bedrock_resolve_version_policy`

Returns the active repo policy for version targeting.

### `bedrock_lookup_manifest_rules`

Returns manifest requirements for the selected pack type and target policy.

### `bedrock_lookup_file_recipe`

Returns the structured recipe for an artifact family.

Examples:

- item
- block
- entity
- loot table
- animation
- controller

### `bedrock_lookup_script_rules`

Returns current scripting guidance relevant to the active target.

### `bedrock_validate_pack`

Runs project validation.

### `bedrock_parse_validation_report`

Converts raw validator output into structured repair input.

### `bedrock_repair_from_errors`

Takes files plus errors and proposes or applies minimal fixes.

### `bedrock_package_project`

Packages a validated project into its final output format.

---

## Validation and repair

### Validation policy

Validation is mandatory.

Every meaningful generation task should end in one of two states:

- **valid**
- **invalid with a precise failure report**

Never stop at âthe files were generated.â

### Completion criteria

A task is complete only when:

- required files exist
- pack structure is coherent
- identifiers are consistent
- validation passes
- script/build checks pass when applicable
- the output is ready for packaging

### Repair policy

Repair should be:

- minimal
- scoped
- explainable
- followed immediately by revalidation

Avoid broad rewrites when only a targeted fix is needed.

## Roadmap

### Milestone 1
Repo foundation and documentation distillation

### Milestone 2
Copilot control surfaces and Bedrock agent profile

### Milestone 3
Initial MCP lookup and validation tools

### Milestone 4
End-to-end generate/validate/repair workflow

### Milestone 5

---

## Fine-tuning policy

Fine-tuning is explicitly **deferred**.

This project will only revisit local model specialization after all of the following exist:

- a working Bedrock tooling pipeline
- repeatable validation
- a real failure corpus
- measurable evidence that prompting + tools is insufficient

### Likely first specialization targets

If local training is added later, the best early candidates are:

1. strict structured JSON generation
2. repair from validator or runtime failures

Not a broad all-purpose Bedrock add-on model.

---

## Success criteria

The project is succeeding when it can reliably do the following:

### Functional success

- generate coherent Bedrock pack structures
- produce correct artifact families for common tasks
- maintain identifier consistency across files
- repair common failures automatically

### Operational success

- require limited manual correction
- make version behavior explicit
- support incremental work inside the repo
- keep outputs repeatable

### Quality success

- high validator pass rate
- consistent packaging success
- clear surfacing of script/build issues
- strong repair performance from failure reports
